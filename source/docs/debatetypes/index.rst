Types of Debate
======================================

Debate is a broad term, but there are a number of types of debate that are commonly used. Generally, all forms of debate involve two or more competitors either defending or attacking a pre-determined course of action, called a resolution. This wiki focuses on a specific type of debate, ``public forum debate``, but there are many other types of debate that are used in the United States and around the world.
