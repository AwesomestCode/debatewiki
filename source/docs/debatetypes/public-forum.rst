Public Forum
======================================

Public forum debate involves two teams of two people each debating for or against a :ref:`resolution`. The resolution changes every two months in the fall term, and then once every month in the spring.

For instance, the resolution for January 2023 was "Resolved: The United States Federal Government should increase its diplomatic efforts to peacefully resolve internal armed conflicts in West Asia."

A coinflip decides the speaking order and also who gets to debate which side
